- improve ApiQueryProvider::Base.shadow (allow user defined aliasing)
- improve field definition on non autogenerated models (rename custom_fields -> field, allow call with no block for default behaviour)
- probably should split ApiQueryProvider::Base into Base and Object, Base serving as interaction layer, Object contains all field handling methods, would allow anonymous objects without much hassle
- improve ApiQueryProvider::Provider.system_symbols, should be a constant as it won't change at runtime
- think about ApiQueryProvider::Provider.execute, does it really need a forced array, could easily just return a single object
- ApiQueryProvider::Base.required_symbols should be cached, api_path shouldn't really change
- make configuration setters private, not needed to expose them
- ApiQueryProvider::Base should automatically try to create objects from nested hashes, also should iterate over arrays
